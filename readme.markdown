# Hat Tournament Team Generator
===============================

This web app is designed to make life easy when creating hat tournaments, that
is tournaments where players enter individually and teams are "randomly" picked
out of a hat. Obviously in principle that method creates unbalanced teams, this app
tries to create teams as balanced as possible.

## TODO
- Wire gender and attribute balancing into the back end
- Add a load of error handling providing useful feedback to the user
- Bucket loads of testing
